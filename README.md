# Churn-Analysis of a Telecom Company for Customer Retention 

#### Context:We are trying to predict whether a customer using a telecom service will leave the service or continue based on the existing information regarding demography and call details. The management of the telecom provider company are invested in this project.

#### Need:Whether it is a telecom company or any other mid sized company or corporation, customers are the key revenue sources.Its important for companies to know how likely a customer will leave the service. Not only is it crucial for a company to know which customers will continue with the service but most importantly, which ones will tend to leave so that the focus can be towards retaining them

#### Vision: The logic behind the solution is how the category of current serives and information regarding the customer affects the final outcome of whether the customer will continue or leave. How much charges for example a customer incurs and the customers satisfaction level are some determinants of the final outcome

#### Outcome: Based on the outcome of how probably customers are leaving and staying will be informative for the higher management. The outcome of the result will help them make strategic decisions which will ultimately change the quality and cost of the services of the company. Finally, it is important to acquire new customers but even more important to retain the existing ones
